How to Build a CLI Gem

1. Plan your gem, imagine your interface
2. Start with the project structure - google
3. Start with the entry point - the file run
4. force that to build the CLI interface
5. stub out the interface
6. start making things real
7. discover objects.
8. program


- a command line interface for covid tracking
- found a website that has covid data APIs


How I want this to Work:
-user can look at national or state covid report data
-for state: user inputs state code and receives output of their stats
-data is listed in an easy-to-read format




git status
git add .
git commit -m " "
git push origin master

#!/usr/bin/env ruby
shebang line-- says this file is a ruby file 
require/require_relative only look at files, not folders
    require is absolute path (./ is entire project), will always look at home folder
    require_relative would be (./without lib)


Covid Tracking app with covid data APIs
// welcome user
// ask for national or state
// if national, list national stats
// if state, ask for state code
// list state stats
// exit 
//"stay safe and make sure to wear a mask! Goodbye"



-CLI class -- dealing with terminal 
-API class -- to deal with API info
-national class -- deal with national stats
-state class -- deal with state stats
